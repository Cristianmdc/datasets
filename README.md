Global Terrorism Database
Maintained by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) at the University of Maryland in College Park, the Global Terrorism Database contains information on more than 150,000 terrorist attacks from 1970 to 2015. It is a rich source of information on terrorist groups across the globe, and the attacks they are responsible for.

You can download the data from here: https://gtd.terrorismdata.com/, selecting the Download full GTD dataset option. An extensive codebook details all of the fields in the data.

The data is provided as a series of spreadsheets in .xlsx format. I suggest that you import this data into Open Refine before processing any further, and create a new field giving the date of each event in standard YYYY-MM-DD format. This can be done from the eventid field. 

Do take care to read the Terms of Use and instructions for citing the source of the GTD data.
